# [ Question No. 1 ]



##  Compile and Run

<ul>
 <li> Install GCC compiler: If you haven't already, you will need to install the GCC compiler on your system. On Unix-like systems, GCC is often pre-installed or can be installed using the package manager. On Windows, you can download and install the MinGW-w64 toolchain from the official website: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/ </li>

 <li>
    Open a terminal or command prompt: Open the terminal or command prompt on your system.
 </li>
 <li>
   Navigate to the directory where the source code file is located: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where the source file (task1.c) is located.
 </li>
 <li>
    Compile the code: Type the following command to compile the code: (gcc task1.c -o run1) <br>
    This command uses the GCC compiler to compile the C code and create an executable file.
 </li>
 <li>
    Run the program: Type the following command to run the program: ./run1
 </li>
</ul>
That's it! You should now be able to run the program and generate the sequence of numbers for the piecewise recurrence relation.
